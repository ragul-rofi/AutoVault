# AutoVault

**AutoVault** is a centralized backup and version control system designed for industrial environments to manage CNC machine programs, PLC logic files, and other critical shop-floor software assets.

It enables:
- Secure file upload and retrieval
- Role-based access management
- Version tracking for every uploaded file
- Centralized visibility of all machine programs

The goal is to eliminate manual backups, prevent data loss, and improve traceability across industrial operations.

This project is developed as part of **Sakthi Hackathon 1.0, 2025**.
